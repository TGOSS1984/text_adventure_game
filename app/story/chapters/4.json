  "text": "Atop the tower, the air thins to frost and fire. A shattered dome lets in a pale, storm-lit sky, where clouds churn like furious spirits. The altar is cracked and scorched, once sacred, now desecrated. Blackened bones lie strewn in ceremonial patterns, as if a ritual was interrupted — or completed.\n\nLightning dances across shattered symbols etched into the stone. Runes meant to bind now flicker with instability. And in the silence, a tremor begins. From the gloom beyond the altar, he rises.\n\nCindergloom. Last of the Flame Lords. His body is wrought of molten iron and dying starfire, wrapped in a tattered cloak of living ash. His face is a mask of charred bone, his gaze searing with ancient hatred.\n\nHe speaks no words. He needs none. This is not a duel. It is a reckoning.",

  "lore": "Cindergloom was born of the First Pyre, shaped in the forges of the divine and cursed by their fall. His flame does not warm. It does not burn. It consumes — will, memory, and soul alike. He is the reason the heavens no longer blaze.",
