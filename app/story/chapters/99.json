  "text": "Cindergloom emerges not with fury, but inevitability. Towering and silent, wreathed in ribbons of embered smoke, he does not speak — for he is fire’s last voice, and it has already spoken through you.\n\nThe battlefield burns with echoes. Every flame you’ve lit, every soul you’ve claimed, they gather here, watching. The ash beneath your feet remembers the steps of every bearer who came before. This fight is not for salvation, nor power. It is to decide whether the flame continues — or ends.\n\nHis strikes are slow, mournful, and yet shattering. Each one tests your resolve not to win, but to understand. Because in Cindergloom’s dying blaze, a choice awaits.",

  "lore": "Cindergloom was once known as Aegor the Quiet Flame — the only bearer who refused both rekindling and forgetting. He lingered. He *watched*. And over centuries, he *became* fire’s sorrow. His defeat will unbind the last will of the First Flame.",
