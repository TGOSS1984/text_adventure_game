Above you stretches a void of swirling cinders and molten light. A cathedral of ash surrounds you, carved not by mortal hands, but by despair given shape.\n\nIn the center, a figure stands — immense, unmoving. Cloaked in flame and ruin, his silhouette flickers between man and monster. Chains of scorched iron drag behind him, inscribed with the names of those who defied him — and burned.\n\nCindergloom. He turns, slow and sovereign. His gaze sears your soul, not in hatred, but recognition.\n\nThe ground shudders. His greatsword, forged of collapsed suns and bound prayers, ignites in silence. You cannot run. You would not.\n\nThe battle has already begun.",
