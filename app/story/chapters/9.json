  "text": "Before you looms the Gate of Ash â€” a monolith scorched by centuries of flame and sorrow. Its surface crackles with veins of ember, pulsing like the last heartbeat of a dying god.\n\nThree paths stretch from its base, each radiating a distinct dread.\n\nTo the left, a trail of molten rock winds into flame-choked valleys, where the air sings with heat and despair.\n\nTo the right, stairs spiral into a bottomless dark, untouched by sun or memory. And ahead lies a ruined causeway littered with idol fragments and the bones of kneeling pilgrims.\n\nEach breath here feels heavier. Each step, a choice that echoes beyond time.",
