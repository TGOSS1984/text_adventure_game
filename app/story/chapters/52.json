  "text": "Beyond the Abyss, the Silent Citadel looms. No banners fly from its towers. No guards pace its ruined halls. It is a fortress of absence, where memories were once imprisoned and truth buried under stone.\n\nAs you ascend its forgotten tower, you hear not echoes, but *anticipation*. The air hums with unkindled energy. Statues line the corridor — warriors, kings, beasts — all with your face. All holding torches long extinguished. This citadel does not remember rulers. It remembers *regret*.",
