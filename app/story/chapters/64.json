At times you see shapes flit just beyond sight — pale silhouettes, some crawling, some drifting, all watching. You come upon a grove where a single tree stands scorched, its bark etched with runes that flicker faintly in your periphery.\n\nYou kneel near the base, brushing aside ash to find a charm of woven silver wire. As your fingers close around it, you hear a voice — yours, but twisted, from a moment that never was: 'You lit the fire once. Will you do so again?' When you rise, the whispers are silent… for now.",
