  "text": "You wander the Echoing Hall, where the air hums with whispers that never fade. The walls are carved with reliefs of open mouths — thousands of them, as though the stone itself wishes to speak. Every step sends a murmur skittering along the floor, bouncing back from shadowed alcoves. Some of the voices are yours.\n\nGhostly melodies drift from nowhere, sometimes weeping, sometimes laughing. This is a place where thoughts manifest as echoes and regrets take shape. The hall stretches infinitely in both directions, though your path is somehow certain. There is something here that remembers you — or something you were meant to remember.",
