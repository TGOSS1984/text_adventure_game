Whispers slither between the stones, and unseen eyes blink from the veil of dark.\n\nThe walls bleed a dim, sickly glow — not from torches, but from memories imprinted into the stone. Names you’ve never heard stir in your mind like nightmares half-remembered.\n\nDeeper still, the shadows converge. Something old moves beyond sight, stirring not with malice, but with hunger. You have come too far to turn away.",
