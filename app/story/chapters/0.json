  "text": "The world ends not with a roar, but with ash. You awaken upon a bed of scorched bones and shattered memory, as the cold winds of Limgrave slice through the ruin. The sky above weeps embers, and every breath you take is drawn from the lungs of something long dead. The bonfire nearby crackles faintly—its light weak, but ancient. Around you, remnants of a shattered age lie buried beneath soot.\n\nYou do not remember your name. Only the scream of steel on steel, a crumbling keep, and a crown burning red in a sea of black. The echo of a great betrayal claws at the edges of your consciousness. Something calls you onward—not for redemption, nor revenge, but something older. The Cycle stirs again, and you have been chosen to tread its cursed rhythm once more.",
