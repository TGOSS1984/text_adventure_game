Far below, molten rivers surge through ruined valleys, carving songs into the stone.\n\nA distant tower risesâ€”its spire broken, its flame long extinguished. Yet something within pulses. You remember standing atop it once, though the memory burns to grasp. Something was left behind there. Or someone.\n\nA figure watches from across the ridge. They turn, cloak trailing, and vanish into the haze.",
