  "text": "You ascend the Tower of Whispers, its winding stairs broken in places, rebuilt with bone, root, and remnants of forgotten prayers. The stone walls are engraved with ancient sigils, many long eroded, some still pulsing faintly with latent power. The higher you climb, the thinner the air becomes — not due to height, but to something… else. Time here bends like smoke.\n\nEach landing echoes with voices — not heard, but felt. Regret, longing, fury — emotions trapped in the stone itself. You reach a wide corridor where the wind does not blow, yet whispers carry still. One phrase rises above the rest, scrawled across a crumbling tapestry: _'The First Flame must forget to be remembered.'_ You do not understand it. Not yet.",

  "lore": "The Tower of Whispers was erected to bind the Storm Tongue — an echo-born force that once unraveled armies with madness. The tower’s keepers inscribed it with silence-runes, hoping to mute what should not be heard. But silence, too, becomes deafening when it lingers long enough.",
