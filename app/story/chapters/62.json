  "text": "You reach the waterlogged shrine, a crumbled sanctum choked with vines and barnacles. Its central brazier, long extinguished, remains a monument to the faith drowned beneath these tides. As you draw near, the shrine pulses faintly, as though remembering warmth.

The shrine grows still, but you feel lighter, your wounds soothed by the sacred flicker of remembrance.",

  "lore": "This shrine belonged to the Tidebound, a sect who believed fire could survive even in water — that faith could ignite even the drowned. Their teachings were banned as heresy. But the Flame remembers all who kneel to it, no matter how deep they fall.",
