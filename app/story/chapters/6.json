  "text": "You enter the Chapel of Thorns, where silence grows like moss. Vines claw across broken pews, weaving through cracked mosaics that once depicted salvation.\n\nAt its heart lies a flame — small, steady, and golden. Not fierce like the pyres of war, but warm, like memory. Dust drifts through shafts of amber light from shattered stained glass. Each step echoes, reverent and uncertain.\n\nYou kneel. The air hums softly. The warmth seeps into your bones, quieting pain and silencing the ghosts that followed you. For a moment — just a moment — the world feels whole again.",
