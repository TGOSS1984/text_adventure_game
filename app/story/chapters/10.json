Your steps echo, but something else echoes back—half a second too late.\n\nA mural along the wall depicts the sundering of the world. The Flame rising, then crumbling. A figure cloaked in ash stands alone, arms outstretched over a broken earth. No name. No crown. Just purpose carved in fire. Deeper into the dark, the tomb calls.",
