  "text": "You plunge into the drowned road, a half-sunken path flanked by skeletal trees and ruins that groan with waterlogged age. The air is thick with brine and rot, every step sinking into muck that clings like memory. The silence here is oppressive, broken only by the occasional drip of unseen water and distant, gurgling echoes that seem too rhythmic to be natural.\n\nCrumbling homes lean askew beneath the weight of the marsh, their windows like blind eyes staring into forgotten yesterdays. Statues of saints eroded to near-animalistic forms weep dark trails into the mud. There’s a strange stillness, as though this village mourns something beyond death — as though it remembers. You feel watched, not by creatures, but by the land itself.",
