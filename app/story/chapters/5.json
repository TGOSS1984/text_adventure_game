Watching.\n\nAsh falls like slow, deliberate snow. Each flake sings faintly as it lands. The world is quieter now, as if holding its breath. You kneel at the broken altar, your reflection shimmering in blood and cinder.\n\nThe choice comes not as a voice, but as a weight. A fork in the soul.\n\nRekindle the Age of Flame and let light return — brilliant, but destined to burn away once more. Or embrace the coming dark, where truth may lie, cold and unyielding.\n\nNo one shall guide you now. You are legend — not for what you fought, but for what you chose. The world waits.",
