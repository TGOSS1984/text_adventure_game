  "text": "The Old Cairn stands silent in the snow, a mound of weathered stones ringed by broken spears and tattered banners. Frost clings to every surface, the weight of years bowing the ancient markers into the ice. A faint warmth lingers here, as if the earth remembers fires long since gone out, and for a moment the wind stills, granting you rare respite. Yet beyond the cairn’s quiet embrace, the valley opens into a vast, frozen expanse—and somewhere in that white abyss, something stirs.",

  "lore": "Once raised to honor the nameless dead of the Forgotten Valley, the Old Cairn has become a solitary refuge for those who dare this frigid waste.
