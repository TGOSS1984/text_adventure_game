When you approach, it sputters. When you kneel, it flares.\n\nVisions seize youâ€”armies drowning in flame, cities built atop the corpses of dragons, and a crown that screams when worn. The flame whispers one word into your soul: 'Return.' Then, silence. You are alone again, save for the warmth that now kindles beneath your skin.",
