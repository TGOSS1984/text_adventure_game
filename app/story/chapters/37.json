  "text": "You approach the Iron Bastion not through its gates, but through a breach half-buried in soot and slag. Inside, the walls are scorched black, the remnants of a siege long lost. Statues line the corridor—warriors caught mid-scream, petrified by some ancient curse.\n\nA faint humming pervades the air. Not mechanical, but melodic—like a lullaby made of rust and sorrow. The deeper you go, the more the song resolves into a single phrase: 'The price of iron is memory.'",
