What was once a bastion of the Flamebearers now lies drowned in silence, choked by creeping vines and ember-choked winds. Statues of forgotten sentinels stare blankly toward the horizon, their swords long dulled by time.\n\nFaint markings on the stone whisper of a forgotten oath, half-buried by soot and moss. The Flame did not die here—it was consumed. And something darker rose in its place. Ahead, two paths reveal themselves: one winding toward a charred boneyard, the other downward into what seems like a broken cathedral swallowed by the land.",
