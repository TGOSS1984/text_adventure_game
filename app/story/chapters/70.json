  "text": "You cross the Lava Tomb, a corridor of glassed stone and searing mist. The floor glows with molten cracks, and the shadows on the walls twitch and pulse with lives of their own. As you press on, you find twisted statues fused into the cavern walls — knights, nobles, and beasts alike, their faces locked in expressions of agony or awe.

A flicker of fire rises as you reach toward your pouch, uncertain of what you’re about to surrender.",
