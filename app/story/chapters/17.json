The ossuary winds deep, too deep for any natural catacomb.\n\nYou pass murals carved in relief—depictions of battles long forgotten, of knights burning, of towers crumbling in reverse. In one, a figure kneels before a flame that weeps. Its face is erased. You feel a strange familiarity with the gesture.\n\nThe deeper you go, the less certain you are that time exists here at all.",
