  "text": "You kneel, and the bonfire sparks to life—not with warmth, but with memory. Visions flood your senses: a tower collapsing into a sea of embers, a crown melting onto a skull, a chorus of unseen voices chanting in a forgotten tongue. The fire knows you, or at least remembers what you were.\n\nA figure flickers in the flame—a knight cloaked in shadows, chained to a throne of rusted iron. You cannot hear its words, but you feel its grief. Then it vanishes, and you are alone again. The flame dims, but within you something kindles: resolve, or perhaps a curse that cannot be named.",
