  "text": "You descend into the Underglare Tomb, where shadow and light war without end. The walls shimmer with false reflections — echoes of faces not your own. The deeper you tread, the more your thoughts turn against you.\n\nAt the tomb’s center lies a dais cracked by time, above which floats the Forgotten Guardian. His form is cloaked in brittle armor and unspoken law. The stone beneath him has worn smooth from centuries of vigil.\n\nHe does not ask why you are here. He does not question fate. He simply raises his axe.\n\nOne word breaks the stillness: 'Judgment.'",
